# Brick Island

Welcome to the **Brick Island** project! This space is designed to build a community of fans who want to collaborate on creating content inspired by the iconic *Lego Island* game.

## 3D Model Enhancements

So far, I have worked on improving the island by updating most of the textures. These have been replaced with high-quality materials compatible with HD, 2K, and 4K resolutions. The goal is to modernize the island’s look while preserving the essence of the original game.

## Help with Optimization

The model file is quite large, and I haven’t been able to reduce its size yet. If anyone has experience optimizing 3D models and can help compress it without significant quality loss, it would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to upload it here so we can all use it more efficiently.

## Model Download

Here’s the .blend file for you to download and modify as you wish:

I hope you like it, and I’m excited to keep improving this project together!
