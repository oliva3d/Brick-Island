# Breaking the Island - The incomplete joke

**The incomplete joke** is a mini-game inspired by the humor and playful style of the classic *Lego Island* series. In this game, players are presented with incomplete jokes and have to select the correct punchline to complete them.

## Features

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the humor found in *Lego Island*, a game that blends adventure with a fun, quirky sense of humor.

Looking ahead, I'm considering creating a similar game inspired by *Monkey Island*. The original *Monkey Island* game is known for its witty dialogue and humorous exchanges, which makes it a great candidate for a joke-based game where players complete dialogue or punchlines. Stay tuned for updates!

## How to Play

1. Read the incomplete joke presented on the screen.
2. Choose from three possible answers to complete the joke.
3. If you select the correct punchline, you'll be able to move to the next joke.
